# HateSpeechHunter
HateSpeechHunter (HSH from now on) is a hate detector developed as a project for SaturdAIs Castellon course, using artificial intelligence for creating a tool that is capable of identifying wether some plain text contains hate speech or not.

The purpose of HSH is to detect hate speech in texts through an intelligent and automated process. HSH is a tool that focuses on the identification phase of hate speech in specific texts. The goal is to reduce the presence of hate on social media platforms, which currently serve as massive sources of information and influence for many people. HSH uses natural language processing and deep learning models to detect hate speech in texts. The tool was developed using a source of data from Kaggle, and the project included data cleaning, model evaluation, and the creation of a user-friendly interface using Gradio. Ultimately, the aim of HSH is to make social media platforms more respectful and positive for all users by detecting and eradicating hate speech.

HSH has been fully built using Python libraries, such as Torch, Pandas, Numpy, Transformers, Gradio for the UI...
